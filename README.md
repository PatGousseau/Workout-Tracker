# Workout Monitor

## Overview 

My workouts are of great importance to me. After using multiple tracking apps over the years, none of them 
 satisfy my exact needs. This application will be customized to my exact needs to ultimately optimize this aspect of my life by using user input
 to accurately track the user's progress. After every set of your workout, the user will log in the number of reps and the weight used. The user will
 then be able to compare their performance to their last workout. Anyone who wants to get the most out of their workouts 
 would be a perfect candidate for this application.


**Program features:**
- User defined workout routines
- Relevant graphs and statistics related to your own workout progress <br/>
